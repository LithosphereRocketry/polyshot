# polyshot
A mostly useless program, written over the course of about 15-30 minutes. Takes
a screenshot; type of screenshot depends on how the script is executed:

* `python3 polyshot`: Takes a screenshot of the whole screen.
* `./polyshot`: Prompts the user for a selection area.

Always saves to `screenshot.png` in the working directory.
